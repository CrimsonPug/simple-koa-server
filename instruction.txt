Here is how you set it up

First unzip the file, once that's done, open the terminal and change directory into 
$cd (wherever the file is)
$cd devChallenge
$cd project2
$npm install

Once everything is installed, run the application by running the command below

$node server.js

or if you have nodemon installed, run this code below

$nodemon server.js

The application should start in http://localhost:3005/. If there is an error, it is likely there is 
another application running on that port/server. 

The next step is to open a new tab in your browser, copy paste http://localhost:3005/ into your search tab you will see 
the temperature of your office on the browser. If you check your terminal there is a more detailed 
description of the weather in an Object.

To change the location, go to server.js and change the value 'var location = 'wherever you want'.


If there is any question let me know!
